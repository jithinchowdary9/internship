# Python Internship Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python Internship Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed during my Python internship. These projects cover a variety of topics and demonstrate my skills in Python programming.

## Project List

1. **Calculator in Python:** This project implements a basic calculator with essential mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a simple command-line interface for performing calculations.

2. **Speed Typing Test in Python:** This project allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. It presents random sentences that the user needs to type accurately within a specified time limit. At the end of the test, it provides statistics on typing speed and accuracy.

3. **Library Management System:** This project simulates a library management system where users can add, search, and borrow books. It provides functionality for maintaining a catalog of books, managing user records, and keeping track of borrowed and returned books.

4. **Password Generator in Python:** This project generates strong and secure passwords. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, including options such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
